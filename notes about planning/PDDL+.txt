=== PDDL+ ===
Note: 
1.	effects are fired as soon as preconditions are met
2.	Effects must delete its own preconditions (no multiple execution of the event)

;; the actions you're used to in common PDDL
(:action action-name
:parameters ( ?par - type1 ?par2 ?par3 - type2 )
:precondition (and (predicate ?par) (formula ?par1 ?par2) )
:effect (and (predicate ?par) (not (predicate2 ?par ?par2) ) )
)

;; flows during the time, something which is happening in a certain amount of time
;;   it represents an action performed every #t seconds! So, use it for updating values, not for predicates!
(:process process-name
:parameters ( ?par - type1 ?par2 ?par3 - type2 )
:precondition (and (predicate ?par) (formula ?par1 ?par2) )
:effect (and (predicate ?par) (not (predicate2 ?par ?par2) ) )
)

;; a sort of trigger, an action which happens when a condition is satisfied, authomatically
(:event event-name
:parameters ( ?par - type1 ?par2 ?par3 - type2 )
:precondition (and (predicate ?par) (formula ?par1 ?par2) )
:effect (and (predicate ?par) (not (predicate2 ?par ?par2) ) )
)

;; functions and events can be bounded with constraints
(:constraint speed_limit
:parameters ()
:condition (and (>= (v) (* -1 (max_speed))) (<= (v) (max_speed)))
)

=== NOTES ON SYNTAX ===
arithmetic operators: 
(op f1 f2)
supported: + - * /

Numeric comparisons:
< <= > >= =

update values
(assign someting value)
(increase something value)
(decrease something value)

get the delta: just like a function, simply write this.
